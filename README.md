## PICK A CARD

# Demo
https://eleanor-shellstrop.github.io/pickacard/

This is a small program I built to practice JavaScript functions and iterators.

Click the "Take One" button to deal to you and the computer. 
If your card is the same value or higher than the computer's card, you win!

Numbered cards are weighted as the value shown, royals are:

  * Jack: 11
  
  * Queen: 12

  * King: 13

  * Ace: 14

Click the "Play Again" button to reset the fields, and click "Take One" to be dealt a new card.
